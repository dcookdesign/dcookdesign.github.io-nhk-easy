NEXT:
- cache information so that it works offline (with the last loaded data)


other:
- any way to detect if a font is loaded... or wait to load content until font is downloaded?



Future:

- add in a way to see words that were clicked (maybe just highlight them in purple!)

- add a way to indicate the current news item selected in the menu; will probably need some kind of ID in the divs

- incorporate (read/not read) with some local storage thing?

- it's very fast loading so it would be good if there was some indicator that the page loaded...

- do something about the videos for each article

- do something for the link to the real article


** FOR DICTIONARY **
- can use jisho.org api for dictionary. example: http://jisho.org/api/v1/search/words?keyword=hello

- or can use this site: 
https://glosbe.com/gapi/translate?from=eng&dest=jpn&format=json&phrase=hello&pretty=true

** Kanji Review: ** 
1. watch it being drawn
2. what does it mean?
3. write it 5 times
4. next

Later:
- review them one by one like flash cards
